					<p class="paragraph1">Innovation and agility are often considered to be concepts that are unavailable to companies who are already established in their respective markets. Too often, the members of various business units within an organization are far too invested with the status quo to allow room for new ways of thinking. Individually, the disruptive forces of Cloud, Big Data, and Agile Development can positively impact an organization. However, when taken together, the synergies provide not only value to existing operations, but can also fuel an engine of innovation alongside the traditional business lines. As EMC Pathfinders, we work to aid customers and companies in linking these mega trends and using them as an engine to drive their business.

					<p class="paragraph2">The Dell | EMC Pathfinder Team concerns themselves with keeping Dell | EMC as a relevant business partner for our customers, both now and in the future. We follow and evaluate trends in IT and industries at large, and help organizations evolve and capitalize on these trends, always focused on keeping Dell | EMC in the role of trusted advisor in highest value parts of the business. In our approach, we are part performance artist, part experimental scientist, part business analyst, and part traveling professor.</p>

					<p class="paragraph3">Additionally, we engage in campaigns with the ability to sit down with leadership, executives, and business folks, and extract the needs and the drivers for how they want their business to change. At the same time, we offer them new insights into things they didn't even know were possible. We then bridge the wants and needs, plus any new insights they buy in on, over to a "tangible" sales campaign, as well as a business partnership with the customer. We know the right products, solutions, consulting engagements, and strategies, that will help achieve business driven financial results for our customers, while establishing the framework for a lasting partnership. This leads to us opening the doors for many future engagements as the "Go To" trusted advisor for not just IT, but business and C-Level folks as well. We win the hearts and minds of the key leaders to become the tirst phone call, when that next project comes up. Most importantly, we continue to engage and educate, even when no active campaigns are present, keeping fresh in the thoughts of our customer's leadership teams.</p>
